# Fed-Ensemble

This repository contains a straightforward code implementation of the Fed-Ensemble framework, a federated learning approach that combines multiple models trained on different subsets of clients to improve the robustness and overall performance of the federated learning system. Fed-Ensemble is introduced in the paper:

[Shi, N., Lai, F., Kontar, R. A., & Chowdhury, M. (2021). Fed-ensemble: Improving generalization through model ensembling in federated learning. arXiv preprint arXiv:2107.10663.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.10663)

You can test the code by running src/main.py.

The core Fed-Ensemble functions are located in src/fedEnsemble.py
